Data munging and visualization with NFL stats.

Download ["ProcessedData/Coaches_Summary/nfl coach summary.xlsx"](https://github.com/zbay/nfl_viz/blob/master/ProcessedData/Coaches_Summary/nfl%20coach%20summary.xlsx) to view the end result of my little project. It's not the most intuitive thing in the world, unless you have a fair understanding of football statistics, but it does accurately describe the strengths and weaknesses of different NFL coaches and coordinators.

I intend to update this project annually.

The spreadsheet contains sortable tables, a few bubble charts, and a year-by-year NFL average stat heatmap. Here's a sample bubble chart, indicating head coach quality.

And here's a small part of the heatmap, which demonstrates trends in the average teams' football statistics over time.
