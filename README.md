Data munging and visualization with NFL stats.

Download "ProcessedData/Coaches_Summary/nfl coach summary.xlsx" to view the end result of my little project. It's not the most intuitive thing in the world, unless you have a fair understanding of football statistics, but it does accurately describe the strengths and weaknesses of different NFL coaches and coordinators.

I intend to update this project annually.
